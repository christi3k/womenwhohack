SUBJECT: Welcome to Women Who Hack!

Hi NAME,

I've just approved your request to join the Women Who Hack list. In this 
email I'm including important information about the group.

Our next meeting is Sunday, DATE from 1 PM - 5 PM:
http://calagator.org/events/search?query=women+who+hack&utf8=%E2%9C%93

Note: External building doors will be locked, so you'll have to 
call/text Christie to get in: 415-317-7603.

Our goal is to support local women hackers (and aspiring hackers) by 
providing a safe, welcoming environment in which they can connect with 
and learn from each other. As such, Women Who Hack is open to all 
self-identified women and genderqueer persons, as well as accompanied 
children of all genders.

There are several ways to connect with other Women Who Hack members, 
online and in person.
