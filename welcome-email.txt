SUBJECT: Welcome to Women Who Hack!

Hi NAME,

I've just approved your request to join the Women Who Hack list. In this 
email I'm including important information about the group.

Our next meeting is this Sunday, 9/1 from Noon-5pm:
http://calagator.org/events/1250464783

Note: External building doors will be locked, so you'll have to 
call/text me to get in: 415-317-7603. I will also check for people at 
Noon, 12:30 and 1pm.

Our goal is to support local women hackers (and aspiring hackers) by 
providing a safe, welcoming environment in which they can connect with 
and learn from each other. As such, Women Who Hack is open to all 
self-identified women and genderqueer persons, as well as accompanied 
children of all genders.

There are several ways to connect with other Women Who Hack members, 
online and in person.
