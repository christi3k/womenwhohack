ATTENDANCE NOTES
******************

Our goal is to support local women hackers (and aspiring hackers) by providing a safe, welcoming environment in which you can connect with and learn from each other.

We're kid-friendly, too, so feel free to bring your children with you.

Women Who Hack is open to all self-identified women and genderqueer persons, as well as accompanied children of all genders.

Please, no fragrances (perfumes, scented lotions, etc.), to make our meetings welcoming to those with chemical sensitivities.
